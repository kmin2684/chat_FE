clean up redux store: 

use context for socket: 

login and signup:
    use html <label> element
    alert window
    setlogout timeout

new chat page routing :
    array as query params:
        https://blog.shalvah.me/posts/fun-stuff-representing-arrays-and-objects-in-query-strings

    history replace

    problem
    newchat page overwritten

    situations:

    solution
    "section" and 
    "room name"
    "members" as parameters

    parse query string
        case 0: query string does not exist || section empty || section doesnt exist
            setSection("new_message")
        case 1: trying to create a new room
            ?section=new_message
        case 2: click a friend for whom a room does not exist
            ?section=add_participants
        case 3: directly to creating a new group chat
            ?section=add_title &members=[a,b,c]
        case 4: 
            ?section=send_message&members=a&member=b&group_name=room1

    newChat:
        set section after initial render based on search query, 

    if no section from query string, section="new_message", ignore  

    places to be fixed
        location.state
            also, in App.js (clicking friend prompting /newchat with {user: friend })
            change to history.push("/newchat?member=friend")
                does member include the logged in user? : no
        in NewChat.jsx set states based on query string
            initially render empty div with blue header 



do not store chat info in chatHistory







reload after logout to clear redux data

spinner when loading app




is loading for fetch 

add greyed out message to right window

login page
registration page 
add friend 
add a new group 
loading 
clear database
change logo and name 

two member group, no group title title,

don't render if location.state

onClickFriend
    if there is a room that have two members that contain the user
        redirect to the room
    else redirect to new chat page

loading function 

reconnect to websocket if disconnected
    setTimeInterval may be needed 

for non group chat remove member length and title requirement 


add_friend: my own username should appear as well in search result

disable newchat form once message sent 

new chat
    if no chats(members.length ===2 ) create new chat
    new chat directly to last page
    setSection('send_message')

    at least two members
    make group title mandatory
    socket send
        if received message has redirect set to true, redirect to the chat 
    {
        newchat
        members
        title
        content
    }

    socket side:
        newChat: room.serialize(token.user, 'brief')
        if sender === userInfo.username
            redirect 

make username lowercase
    convert to lowercase from the client side
    how can i make it lowercase when i am using serializer on the serverside when loggin in?

add friend 
    search friend
        if already friend, do not show "add fried" button
    no RESULT
    after adding friend, add the new friend to the friend list on the front end

(1st render completed) userInfo = loading, room = loading
    GettingUserInfo GeneralUpdating
(2nd render completed) userInfo = updated, room = loading
    General Updating


fetch rooms and chats 
    Fix General Update so that it only fires when user is logged in 
        see if token exists in userInfo

responsesive design
    change class name (.left and .right)

login
    send request to server
    if response is successful
        save to local storage
        update state in app.js 

    if logged in is true, redirect to main page 

    if userInfo already in local storage
        check the token 

make a new room form 
    on the left side (mobile friendly)
    make group name mandatory for group chat
        field that shows only when more than 1 person selected 
        url: /new
chat window css 

current user state

redo the css layout 

upload on git

match user to chatroom on click 

render state data

configuring root route
    remove hyperlink
    remove triling // and match the number of ".." with the number of "//"
